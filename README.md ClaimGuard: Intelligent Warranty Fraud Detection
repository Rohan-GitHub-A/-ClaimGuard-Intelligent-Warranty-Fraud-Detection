# 📄 Warranty Claim Fraud Detection

## 🔍 Project Summary
This project focuses on building **Machine Learning models to detect fraudulent warranty claims**. Fraudulent warranty claims cost companies millions of dollars annually, and early detection can save operational costs, improve customer service, and reduce financial losses.

The dataset contains customer warranty claim records, including product details, service center, claim value, call details, and whether the claim was **fraudulent (1)** or **genuine (0)**.

Our goal is to **identify fraudulent patterns** and build predictive models that flag suspicious claims while minimizing false positives.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
* **Target Variable**: `Fraud` (1 = Fraudulent, 0 = Genuine)
* **Dataset Size**: 334 total samples with 8.1% fraud cases (severe class imbalance)
* **Key Features**:
   * `Product_type` – Type of product (AC, TV, etc.)
   * `AC_1001_Issue`, `TV_2003_Issue` – Product-specific issue codes
   * `Service_Centre` – Claim processing center
   * `Claim_Value` – Monetary value of claim
   * `Product_Age` – Age of product in days
   * `Call_details` – Call duration for claim inquiry
   * `Purchased_from` – Source of purchase
   * `Purpose` – Purpose of contact

## 🔧 Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Distribution of fraud vs non-fraud claims across **products, service centers, purchase sources**.
* Fraudulent claims are **concentrated in specific service centers**.
* Fraud cases often have **higher claim values** compared to genuine claims.
* Product age and call duration show distinct differences between fraud and non-fraud.

### 2. Data Preprocessing & Class Imbalance Handling
* **Stratified Train-Test Split**: Used `stratify=df['Fraud']` to maintain 8.1% fraud distribution in both sets
* **SMOTE Balancing**: Applied Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique to balance training data from 22 fraud cases to ~245 fraud cases
* **Feature Engineering**: Enhanced dataset with domain-specific fraud indicators
* **Encoding**: Converted categorical variables into numerical format
* **Critical Strategy**: 
  - **Training Data**: Used SMOTE-balanced data for model training
  - **Test Data**: Kept original imbalanced distribution for realistic evaluation

### 3. Machine Learning Modeling & Overfitting Prevention
* **Algorithms Implemented**: 
  - **Decision Tree Classifier**
  - **Random Forest Classifier** 
  - **Logistic Regression**

* **Hyperparameter Tuning Strategy**: Grid Search with **anti-overfitting focus**:
  ```python
  # Anti-overfitting parameters for Random Forest
  param_grid = {
      'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
      'max_depth': [3, 5, 7],           # Controlled depth
      'min_samples_leaf': [5, 10, 15],  # Larger leaves prevent overfitting
      'min_samples_split': [10, 15, 20], # Conservative splitting
      'criterion': ['gini', 'entropy']
  }
  ```

* **Evaluation Strategy**: 
  - **5-fold Cross-validation** with F1-score optimization
  - **Overfitting Analysis**: Monitored training vs test accuracy gaps
  - **Scoring Focus**: F1-score over accuracy for imbalanced fraud detection

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Class Imbalance Solution
```python
# Strategic approach to handle 8.1% fraud cases
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# 1. Stratified split maintains fraud distribution
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.20, stratify=y, random_state=42
)

# 2. SMOTE balancing on training data only
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_train_balanced, y_train_balanced = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

# 3. Train on balanced, test on original distribution
model.fit(X_train_balanced, y_train_balanced)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)  # Real-world evaluation
```

### Overfitting Prevention Strategy
```python
# Conservative Random Forest parameters
rfc = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=5,           # Prevent deep overfitting
    min_samples_split=20,  # Conservative splitting
    min_samples_leaf=10,   # Larger leaves
    random_state=42
)
```
